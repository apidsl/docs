## Install [<span style='font-size:20px;'>&#x270D;</span>](https://github.com/apidsl/bash/edit/main/DOCS/INSTALL.md)

I did last time some wrapper for bash, python, ... with such format: load("domains.txt")

```apidsl
load("domains.txt")
.split("/n")
.http()
.xpath("title")
.appendToFile("titles.txt")
```

I am using it to build multiplatform scripts, where the same sentence will be executed on PHP, Python, JS, ...

### The Inspiration was coming from such projects:

+ [jQuery, DOM Traversal and Manipulation](https://jquery.com/)
+ [Apache Camel uses a Java Domain Specific Language or DSL for creating Enterprise Integration Patterns or Routes in a variety of domain-specific languages (DSL)](https://camel.apache.org/manual/dsl.html)
